\section{Background}

\section{Research aims and motivations}

% why is this a non trivial problem

\section{Objectives and scope}

- analyse how diurnal variation is affected
- analyse how atmospheric circulations work
- analyse surface energy balance
- evaluate effect of condensation
- analyse the implications of this for wind energy generation
- devise a set of general principles for assessing how land cover will affect surface winds

\section{Thesis statement and hypothesis}

\section{Overview and structure of thesis}

Note that you may have multiple \texttt{{\textbackslash}include} statements here, e.g.\ one for each subsection.

General structure of this chapter should read as follows.  This chapter should be used to motivate your study and answer the question ``Why is this important?''. Also, it should define what you set out to achieve (these will be revisited in the conclusions chapter). You should describe your approach to the Aims and Objectives, including an evaluation part.
