\section{Software}

This section should include a recipe of what you did (explain what you have done so if someone wants to reproduce the experiment, they can).  A flow chart is typically helpful.  Also, make sure to define all software that you used including version numbers and OS.  Should also include a description of statistical methods used (if any).\footnote{For more information see: \url{http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/49/10/1229.short}}
