\section{Approach}

The general approach that's been applied here is to use modelled outputs (derived from empirical data) to identify spatiotemporal correlations between vegetation change and atmospheric variables. The rationale for this is that although it is often difficult to identify whether a (semi-)empirical observation is the result of some physical mechanism(s) or just a chance occurrence, where a relationship holds tightly through space and/or time the latter is much less likely to be the case. Therefore, if a spatiotemporal correlation between two (or more) variables can be identified, it is suggestive that there is some underlying relationship which is not due to chance, especially if the correlation is very strong (for example, if the spatial distribution of some variable has a very particular shape yet coincides almost exactly with the spatial distribution of another variable). Furthermore, we would have even greater confidence that an identified pattern represents a non-spurious relationship if such a pattern were present in data across various disparate regions.

Even if such a suggestive relationship can be identified, the question still remains regarding whether there is a causal relationship (direct or indirect) between the variables, or whether there are confounding factors with the effect of producing the identified relationship. In the context of science, the question of causation can only be raised sensibly relative to a theoretical framework, which in turn must be at least internally consistent and congruent with rigidly established scientific frameworks (such as the laws of physics) - unless there is extraordinary evidence to reject the latter. Evidence of a causal relationship between empirical variables is then equivalent to there being a logically sound (or at least plausible) explanation within that theoretical framework as to why the identified relationship holds, and for which there exists empirical data supporting the proposed explanation.

Where there are multiple such frameworks and discussion of results crosses over multiple frameworks, the "causes" of something should be specified along with the framework which the "causes" are relative to so as to avoid confusion. If there is an insistence upon using only a single framework, the choice is a matter of judgement but historically \citep{kuhn1970}, selecting a framework \textit{for general use} has been weighted upon criteria such as: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Accurate: "demonstrated agreement with the results of existing experiments and observations" \citep{kuhn1977}
	\item Consistent: "not only internally or with itself, but also with other currently accepted theories applicable to related aspects of nature" \citep{kuhn1977}
	\item Broad Scope: "consequences should extend far beyond the particular observations, laws or subtheories it was initially designed to explain" \citep{kuhn1977}
	\item Simple: "bringing order to phenomena that in its absence would be individually isolated and, as a set, confused" \citep{kuhn1977}
	\item Fruitful: "disclose new phenomena or previously unnoted relationships among those already known" \citep{kuhn1977}
\end{enumerate}



(Select framework to analyse a particular problem)

(Mention how this will be relevant as this study area is still not well understood and there are various proposed frameworks)

(Explain choice to plot main statistics of MDP since this is the easiest way to visualise diurnal profiles, but mention plotting by hourly values is also possible)

(Explain 5-year rolling avg of climate indices)

(Explain use of study regions)

\section{Software}

This section should include a recipe of what you did (explain what you have done so if someone wants to reproduce the experiment, they can).  A flow chart is typically helpful.  Also, make sure to define all software that you used including version numbers and OS.  Should also include a description of statistical methods used (if any).\footnote{For more information see: \url{http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/49/10/1229.short}}
