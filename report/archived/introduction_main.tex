\section{Thesis statement and hypothesis}

\section{Overview and structure of thesis}

Note that you may have multiple \texttt{{\textbackslash}include} statements here, e.g.\ one for each subsection.

General structure of this chapter should read as follows.  This chapter should be used to motivate your study and answer the question ``Why is this important?''. Also, it should define what you set out to achieve (these will be revisited in the conclusions chapter). You should describe your approach to the Aims and Objectives, including an evaluation part.
