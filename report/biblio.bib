abstract = {Recently, circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) fabricated with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are developed rapidly. However, most devices are fabricated by vacuum deposition technology, and developing efficient solution-processed CP-OLEDs, especially nondoped devices, is still a challenge. Herein, a pair of triptycene-based enantiomers, (S,S)-/(R,R)-TpAc-TRZ, are synthesized. The novel chiral triptycene scaffold of enantiomers avoids their intermolecular $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking, which is conducive to their aggregation-induced emission characteristics and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 85{\%} in the solid state. Moreover, the triptycene-based enantiomers exhibit efficient TADF activities with a small singlet-triplet energy gap ($\Delta$EST) of 0.03 eV and delayed fluorescence lifetime of 1.1 µs, as well as intense circularly polarized luminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) of about 1.9 × 10−3. The solution-processed nondoped CP-OLEDs based on (S,S)-/(R,R)-TpAc-TRZ not only display obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with gEL values of +1.5 × 10−3 and −2.0 × 10−3, respectively, but also achieve high efficiencies with external quantum, current, and power efficiency up to 25.5{\%}, 88.6 cd A−1, and 95.9 lm W−1, respectively.},
